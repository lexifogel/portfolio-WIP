              <h3>Stages and Deliverables</h3>
              <h4>Defining the Problem and Project Scope</h4>
               <p>Through the first half of this semester, my team worked with community stakeholders to understand 
                who our users are and how they interact with data and tools to support community objectives and goals. 
                This was primarily experience research; we assessed the existing lab resources for usability and 
                aesthetic problems both on our own and with stakeholders and brainstormed potential solutions to  
                these issues.</p>
                <!-- <p><span class="smaller">Deliverable: Problem statement memo</span></p> -->
                <ul class="smaller"><li>Deliverable: Problem statement memo</li></ul>


                <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                <p>After we established the primary problems with the current site, we began developing 
                prototypes of what we wanted the platform to look like. We then presented our prototype models to 
                representatives of the Huron River Watershed Council, our primary stakeholder, and received more 
                feedback and revised further.</p>
                <!-- <p><span class="smaller">Deliverable: Prototypes</span></p> -->
                <ul class="smaller"><li>Deliverable: Prototypes</li></ul>

                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p>Soon we began working to create the first semester deliverable for our project â€“ an updated dashboard 
                website. Here we found that a lot more research was required as none of our team members 
                had ever worked with any of the potential platforms (Plotly, Grafana, Tableau) before this project. 
                We spent a decent amount of time investigating the pros and cons of each of these platforms and 
                understanding how they each constructed a functional dashboard site. We finally came to a decision 
                on which to use and then moved into more specific research of the functionality and documentation of 
                this one software (Plotly!). </p>
                <!-- <p><span class="smaller">Deliverable: Platform memo</span></p> -->
                <ul class="smaller"><li>Deliverable: Platform memo</li></ul>

                <h4>Development</h4>
                <p>At this point in the project, we thought it would be beneficial to further divide into sub-teams based 
                on our prior experiences and capabilities. We developed a coding team, that worked on the fundamentals 
                of the site development. We also established a creative team, who worked to bring our prototype 
                visualizations (scatterplots, maps, subway maps, etc) to life. Having developed static versions of all 
                of these features, we ended the semester working to implement each into the site and allow for interactions 
                between them.</p>
                <!-- <p><span class="smaller">Deliverable: Partially-completed site</span></p> -->
                <ul class="smaller"><li>Deliverable: Partially-completed site, <a href="#dwl-appendix-A">Appendix A</a></li></ul>
                
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately, since we really challenged ourselves here, we were unable to finish some of the 
                more advanced features we had hoped to have on the site. In addition, we were never able to host the site 
                outside our local machines as the commercial license was way too expensive and we didn't have the skills 
                to find a workaround.</p>
                <ul class="smaller"><li>See a screenshot of our final product for semester 1 in 
                  <a href="#dwl-appendix-A">Appendix A</a></li></ul>
                <!-- specific appendix link ? -->

                <h4>Learnings</h4>
                <p>This semester taught us that you have to make a project plan or you may ultimately go nowhere. We did 
                  a ton of work this semester, but not necessarily the work we should have been doing. Moving into 
                  the second semester, I saw a few main takeaways:</p>
                <ul class="takeaways">
                  <li>Set due dates for milestone tasks</li>
                  <ul class="takeaways">
                    <li>This one is twofold; we neither set milestones nor due dates this semester. Taking this project 
                      one day at a time allowed us to be creative and learn a lot but was not very effective at 
                      working towards execution. Setting distinct stages and due dates for their deliverables 
                      guarantees we will achieve something tangible by the end of semester two.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Utilize subteams of 2-3</li>
                  <ul class="takeaways">
                    <li>Since we had both a large (7 members) and diverse (interdisciplinary) team, working altogether 
                      was never really feasible. Using subteams will allow us to divide and conquer and at the same time 
                      collaborate within those groups more effectively.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Find a better way to maintain accountability</li>
                  <ul class="takeaways">
                    <li>In addition to the methods mentioned in the prior takeaways, I believe that assigning task leads 
                      will help individual members feel a greater sense of repsonsibility and involvement in the project.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>


            <!-- <div class="proj-section">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>This stage also required a lot of research, as we had to determine the best way to execute the 
                  redesign once confirmed. We researched and performed a 
                  <a href="dwl-media/platform-memo.pdf" target="_blank">competitive analysis</a>
                  on 3 potential platforms and determined that Plotly was the most viable. Next, we had to go through 
                  Plotly's documentation and teach ourselves how to use it as we worked</p>
            </div> -->

            <div class="proj-section">
              <h2 id="summer-devs">Summer Developments</h2>
              <p>It was clear at the end of our first semester that we needed some sort of direction moving forwards. 
                Those of us intending to stay on asked our faculty mentors for a (hopeful) list of deliverables they 
                deemed valuable so we could spend our time on execution. They gave us 6 and said they'd be happy with 3.</p>
              <p>At the beginning of the summer we lost two members. The four of us that stayed throughout worked 
                to align on a project plan for the upcoming fall semester focused on 3 of the deliverables we had been 
                given: a subway map, a GIS model, a citizen engagement project. We also left time for work on the 3 
                other deliverables we had been given but did not assign those project leads.</p>
              <p>Since I had the most coding experience and was the only design-oriented major, I planned to 
                take charge on the subway map (which we anticipated to be the most code-heavy). Two of my three 
                colleagues agreed to lead the other projects.</p>
              <p>At the end of the summer we gained two new computer science members. This was fantastic because I 
                really felt the expertise was necessary but presented a challenge in terms of our project plan. To 
                create a space where everyone's time was being used most efficiently, we agreed that I would lead 
                the subway project through the design stage and then pass it off to a CS colleague when we 
                reached development.
              </p>
          </div>

            <div class="proj-section">
                <h2 id="semester2">Semester 2</h2>
                <h3>Stages and Deliverables (Individual)</h3>

                <h4>Subway Map Project</h4>
                <p>This was the stage of the project that best fit my expectations for the entire FEAST experience. 
                  As the design lead, I utilized our stakeholder research from last semester to develop an initial 
                  Figma prototype. I presented it to the group, got feedback, made modifications, and then handed 
                  the design off once it had advisor approval. Although my engagement with this project was very 
                  short, it gave meaning to a lot of my work from the prior semester and allowed me to utilize 
                  my expertise rather than learning new skills.</p>
                 <ul class="smaller"><li>Deliverable: Subway map prototypes,

                 <!-- link prototypes -->

                 <h4>GIS Model Project</h4>
                 <p>After my role with the subway map was complete I shifted over to digitization of Huron 
                  River Watershed bathymetry data.</p>

                  <h4>GIS Digitization Automation Efforts</h4>
                  <p>We faced an interesting dilemma with digitization: it was slow and tedious, but it worked. 
                    We had the option to dedicate a portion of our time towards automating this process with 
                    different external programs and softwares but risked failing and wasting time yet again.</p>
                  <p>Naturally I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to learn and chose to do some automation 
                    research. I didn't get it to work, but I worked with some new softwares and had some interesting 
                    findings. My efforts are documented below.
